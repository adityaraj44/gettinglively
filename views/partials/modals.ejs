          of the visitors to its Website located at http://www.gettinglively.com

          informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection,

          Information you submit to us through the Website or Services. It also
          describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your
          personal information. The use of information collected through our
          service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for
          which the Client has engaged Getting Lively. Unless otherwise defined
          herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such
          terms set forth in the Getting Lively Terms and Conditions that you

          “Personal Information” is any information that allows us (or others)
          to identify an individual person and would include (for example) your
          name, address, email address, IP Address or phone number, as well as
          other non-public information that is associated with or directly
          linked to such information.
        </p>
        <p>
          An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is
          automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In
          some cases, your IP Address stays the same from browser session to
          browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider,
          your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP
          Addresses solely in conjunction with session Cookies to analyze our
          web page flow and to determine the appropriate language settings for
          you based on your region if you did not previously indicate. You can

          processing, account inquiries, and marketing analytics. These third

          We may enter into co-branding or co-promotional agreements with third

          disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that
          such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to
          respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Getting Lively; (b) to
          protect and defend the rights or property of Getting Lively or users

          from unauthorized or unlawful access, use, or disclosure and against
          accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, such Personal
          Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting Lively has implemented industry-standard electronic means of
          protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal Information
          behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders
          from accessing our servers, and we have implemented technology to
          detect intrusions. We also require you to enter a password to access
          your account information. In addition, Getting Lively protects your
          Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your
          Personal Information in a controlled facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Getting Lively
          limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those
          persons (including employees and contractors) in Getting Lively’s
          organization who have a business need for such access. Lastly, we
          conduct periodic internal audits and vulnerability scans to ensure
          compliance with these security measures and generate security incident
          logs that track Information useful in screening for attempted abuse of
          or unauthorized access to your Personal Information.

          Even though Getting Lively has taken significant steps to ensure that
