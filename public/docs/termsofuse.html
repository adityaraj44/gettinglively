However, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Products to you at the incorrect (lower) price; and</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">8.5.2. if the Product&#39;s correct price is higher than the price stated on our website, we will contact you as soon as possible to inform you of this error and we will give you the option of continuing to purchase the Product at the correct price or cancelling your Order. We will not process your Order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the Order process, we will treat the Order as cancelled and notify you in writing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">9.
