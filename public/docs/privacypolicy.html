Who we share personal information with:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In delivering our Services to you, depending on the circumstances, we may share your personal information with the following entities:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Customers who place Orders with your Business via our Website.

Generally Customers will contact you to tell you about their special dietary requirements for their Order (such as allergies, intolerances and religious food requirements) or they may wish to give you specific instructions for delivering/picking up their Order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We also share your personal information with our third party customer support teams, website and application support, and hosting providers, marketing service providers, market research companies, and payment processing providers which facilitate payment card transactions - any of these third parties may be inside or outside of the country where your Business is based.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Companies within the Getting Lively group of companies (which means our subsidiaries and affiliates, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates) - these companies act for us and process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If any part of our business enters into a joint venture, purchases another business or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their agents and advisors. In these circumstances we will always inform the relevant entities that they must only use your personal information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Any other person provided that you have given your consent to the disclosure. We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. Legal basis for processing personal information</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our main reason for collecting and using your personal information is so we both can perform the obligations set out in our Business Agreement with you (i.e. to ensure you have full access to our Services). However we will also use your personal information where it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if our interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms). In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you (e.g. in the event of legal proceedings) or we might need to process it or share it with others to &ldquo;protect your vital interests&rdquo; (i.e. to help save your life) or those of another person (e.g. in a case where an another person&rsquo;s life is in danger).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we&rsquo;ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party). Relevant legitimate interests includea) to market to you or make you offers that we believe will interest you; b) to analyse and understand how our services are used and so to improve them; c) for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts; or d) to keep our systems secure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the &ldquo;How to contact us&rdquo; heading below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. International data transfers</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Getting Lively takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Some of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commission&rsquo;s approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Getting Lively group of companies all over the world) and contracting with Privacy Shield certified companies in the United States, where this is appropriate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5. Security</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure. As such we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures and industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services. We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6. Data retention</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting Lively will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">7. Your data protection rights</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting Lively respects your privacy and data protection rights.

Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the &ldquo;How to contact us&rdquo; heading below</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by changing your marketing preferences in the preference centre in your account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Similarly, if we collect and process your personal information on the basis of your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">8.
